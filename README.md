#DESCRIPTION

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API with Python to retrieve real-time data and transform it into meaningful visual insights. The primary objective is to fetch data from a public API (such as OpenWeatherMap) using HTTP requests, process the received JSON data, and visualize key patterns using Python data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
